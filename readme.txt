== Description ==

With this plugin you will have the opportunity to visitors to spamming or inflict damage on your side ruled out.
These visitors will see only a predefined HTML of your page. These visitors have no way to return your
Content to see. When we speak of visitors, we are talking about IPs, because a script always needs a reference point at which it
can hold on, that can be compared to the people who always have to know the other's face to get him to
to remember. By and large, that is, when the visitor changes his IP using a proxy server or the like can
the script does not recognize him and he has access to your content again.
